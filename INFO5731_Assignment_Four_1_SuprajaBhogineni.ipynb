    "(30 points). Sentiment analysis also known as opinion mining is a sub field within Natural Language Processing (NLP) that builds machine learning algorithms to classify a text according to the sentimental polarities of opinions it contains, e.g., positive, negative, neutral. The purpose of this question is to develop a machine learning classifier for sentiment analysis. Based on the dataset from assignment three, write a python program to implement a sentiment classifier and evaluate its performance. Notice: **80% data for training and 20% data for testing**.  \n",

My kid had received a couple of hundred dollars in Amazon gift cards and some cash for her birthday.

The gift cards helped defray the cost. She got what she wanted in perfect condition.

The phone was barely used, inside an office but it was a needed line. A screen protector and cover were installed as the phone was being setup.Over a month of use, the screen started playing games. It would show random patterns or freeze but given that there were updates in between those days, I thought it had to do with updates. However, the issues would continue to happen more and more often and lasting longer so I decided to return, since it was obvious the screen was faulty.CPRTX decided the only thing they needed to return was 72 cents out of the $564 of the phone. Despite being covered by the A to Z Amazon Guarantee, I'm still fighting for my refund - and hope I don't get $565 stolen from them. They keep saying I damaged the phone but their own pictures show a pristine, perfect screen, except when turned on.Otherwise, the iPhone 11 was impeccable. You could tell they did some work by looking at the screws at the bottom but other than that, beautiful. The screen did not seem original but it was working great and so was everything else. You could not believe someone had used that phone before which confirms that there are people out there, like myself, who take really good care of their devices.iOS 14.6 works great in the iPhone 11 and the camera does a better job than the iPhone 6 Plus it replaced. You will also enjoy the added screen size (if you're coming from any of the iPhone Pluses) despite having a smaller device. I do miss TouchID and you will too. Overall, iPhone 11, a great phone. CPRTX - Thieves!So a big warning. Do not trust this (CPRTX) seller. They will do everything in their power to steal from you and do not care if the ship to you a faulty phone. They feel Amazon backs them up. I will update if something new happens.\", 'There was a problem loading comments right now.

Though I can use it fine and my SIM card works , for some reason it won’t fully register with my provider online and when I chatted with an agent through Verizon they said my phone was non-Verizon device and they were unable to unlock it which again begs the question is it truly unlocked?

Second after finally getting the phone to activate after letting it die out for a day because you have to turn a phone off & on for proper activation it finally started to work. I had gotten a screen protector & phone case for this iPhone 11 all for it not to work. After four days of having the phone i could no longer have a conversation on the phone. I could answer the phone & people could hear me but I couldn’t hear them, Then shortly after being on the phone it would hang up & say call failed. When I was on FaceTime the front camera was glitching on the video. I’ve had enough of this phone. Called straight talk this morning to have my minutes transferred to my other phone, will be taking my screen protector & case off && taking my new sims card out to return this phone TODAY for a full refund. This is my second time purchasing a phone from Amazon & BOTH times the phones were defects or glitches how you wanna say. I will NOT be ordering anymore phones online again.

They fix these phones that’s broke & try to sell them thinking they’ve found a dummy because most won’t return the phone but I had a little time today & will have more when I get my refund today.

The camera is perfect and the phone battery life is better.', '                Very glad i purchased', \"  I bought mine from Metro, so my only choices were black or red, went with black though it sits in a case anyway. Stuck with 64GB, but I don't use too many apps nor plan to keep photos/videos stored on it.As someone who has been on Android since the start of smartphones, this is THE time where jumping to iOS is going to be the most smooth, and you'll enjoy a few extra features. This won't happen until iOS 14, but once it's released, it will make this phone a great choice even for users used to Android.The phone, like many other phones, is a little too smooth for holding, which makes pressing buttons by accident a thing, so slap on a case not only to protect it, but to make handling better. One upcoming feature in iOS 14 is the ability to tap the back of the phone for your chosen options, so it's yet to be known if protective cases will get in the way of that functionality. I don't use headphones much, but it is still annoying knowing these phones no longer have an analogue 3.5mm audio jack. The packaging is top notch tho, and I've been using the screen protector it shipped with, even though I don't think it's meant to stay on the phone lol, but if it gets bubbles or just gets too damaged, I'll just replace it. It still ships with a ton of apps you may or may not use. I don't use a few of them and a couple cannot be deleted. iOS 14 will allow us to hide them tho, so this will soon be a thing of the past. Getting used to navigating the system doesn't take too long, even to an Android user. Eventually things just flow.I picked this phone because it's as good as the 11 pro/pro max, but without the telephoto lens, and still bigger than the 11 pro. I felt it was a reasonable compromise since I will rarely need the optical zoom capabilities of the pro max. The wide lens is something I will use far more since it comes in handy when you want to take pictures of a room and sometimes you simply have no space to move far back enough. That's the rear cameras, but the front camera can also do .5 wide, which is good for vloggers/irl streamers, especially if you ever need to include another person in the shot.Setup is ez pz and now you can import your stuff not only if you are upgrading from another iPhone, but you can also import stuff from Android, you only need to download an app to the Android phone for it to work.I haven't used all the features of the phone yet, but it looks like it's going to be a good experience, at least until Apple decides to slow it down to coerce me to upgrade lol.\", 'Producto recomendable', '  The phone works great but I’m disappointed by the scratches the backside has some scratches but the scratch in the frontside at the bottom left is noticeable I wish they would show a picture of the phone to sell and not get surprised when it comes in', 'Ok', '  Came quick , no issues with my phone so far.

The battery life was at 100 percent. I had no complaints. One thing I noticed was that the app snapchat is glitchy on the phone. If you try to edit something for your story it just discards it after 30 seconds. Other than that,  it didn't come with earphones. As most people know the Iphone 11 has no headphone jack. So it's crucial that when we buy these phones we should get everything like new. Also, the charger is probably only a foot long. I like to play games or change my music while i'm laying down. I can't do that because the charger is so short. Last but not least, when you get the phone, the instructions are horrible. It tells you to download an app and what not, that just glitches your phone. Don't do it. Instead look up a video online on how to insert a sim card into an Iphone. From there, when you turn on the phone it will have instructions set up from apple. Do not! I repeat do not! Use the instructions provided. If you are switching from android to apple, it will take you longer to set up your phone because you need an apple ID. Also, you need to save your contacts, and write them down. Even after saving all my contacts to my sim card, when I inserted it, none were there.

It is almost as if devices are programmed to break after 30 days. In my personal case, the iPhone I purchased after a week of normal use suffered critical issue. Customer service did not respond to the most recent message from me via email. After speaking to them on phone they stated resolution would be a refund. Do you have a back up device? I hope so. In the lucky case of an exchange (which I pushed for) brace yourself for longer than promised times to receive new product. There is a chance this turns into groundhog day but I hope you receive a working product that endures.Overall enterprise and business solution, would be to place more in reserves for replacement and increase service ability to send new product with promissory of receiving broken product. Filling this void, keeping customers whole while resolving issue. Leaving customers a loaner device would increase their reputation, making them the tallest in a room of short people but hey, you would purchase with confidence under that premise right? Do not buy from this organization if you plan to gift. Please do your loved one a favor and keep BUYSRY's mediocre business and risk to yourself. Just buy her something new you cheapskate!

Her fingers don’t always have a good tactile feel and has a hard time doing screen motions.She wasn’t to keen on the Face ID either.So after looking at the IPhone XR, XS Max and the 11, I decided to go with the 11. I looked through about 15 vendors and their review scores. This vendor came through pretty well. There is a small nick in the paint right above the power button, case hides it though.The battery is at 100%!! I did have some questions about the ear speaker. The calls were sounding crackly. I called Amazon and got disconnected but they emailed me and said to try and brush the ear speaker out. I did it and it seems to have helped but I don’t know if it’s 100%.The phone is great, It came with a screen protector on it and I don’t like those at all but it is on there very well so I’ll leave it for now.My girlfriend is getting my IPhone 8+ which has a bigger screen than hers and retains the home button.Overall happy with it, it does take some time getting use to it without a home button but Face ID works well.', 'Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2021Size: 128GBColor: PurpleService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase', '                Yes, you should.', 'There was a problem loading comments right now.

Lo estaré probando por varios meses y si detectó algo raro lo publicaré.Pd. El face ID jala bien, la cámara igual y en las pocas horas que llevo de uso no se me ha trabado.Actualización: llevo dos semanas de uso y el teléfono se ha comportado a la perfección. La batería me dura un día y medio con uso moderado (sólo uso redes sociales y de vez en cuando veo algún video). También en cuanto a la carga creo que está bien. Lo pongo a cargar cuando está entre 15% y 20% y normalmente se carga en hora y media.Seguiré reportando camaradas!De momento recomiendo ampliamente a este vendendor ya que igual compré un iPhone X y tampoco ha tenido fallas e incluso llegó con estética de 10 y batería al 100%', '          A.on(\"a:popover:beforeShow:R2X3UDI5D6FGZS_gallerySection_main\", function(data) {', 'Llego en buenas condiciones y funciona súper bien', \"  I have never bought a used phone before and I've never bought one online.

The phone already came cracked on the side where the lock button is, I guess that’s why the phone won’t power off for me to complete the activation. Second after finally getting the phone to activate after letting it die out for a day because you have to turn a phone off & on for proper activation it finally started to work. I had gotten a screen protector & phone case for this iPhone 11 all for it not to work. After four days of having the phone i could no longer have a conversation on the phone. I could answer the phone & people could hear me but I couldn’t hear them, Then shortly after being on the phone it would hang up & say call failed. When I was on FaceTime the front camera was glitching on the video. I’ve had enough of this phone. Called straight talk this morning to have my minutes transferred to my other phone, will be taking my screen protector & case off && taking my new sims card out to return this phone TODAY for a full refund. This is my second time purchasing a phone from Amazon & BOTH times the phones were defects or glitches how you wanna say. I will NOT be ordering anymore phones online again. First time shame on you, second time shame on me & there will NOT BE A THIRD. People please read these reviews carefully because the person selling you the phone do NOT care. They fix these phones that’s broke & try to sell them thinking they’ve found a dummy because most won’t return the phone but I had a little time today & will have more when I get my refund today.

Though I can use it fine and my SIM card works , for some reason it won’t fully register with my provider online and when I chatted with an agent through Verizon they said my phone was non-Verizon device and they were unable to unlock it which again begs the question is it truly unlocked?

It has a few problems but it is a solid iPhone.Camera: This phone takes really good pictures. It has live photos you can blur out your backgrounds and even up the camera to 4k. It has a nighttime mode where you can change your picture to look like it was taken during the day. It is a cool thing but the zoom in the future is not that good, it comes out blurry.Battery; The battery life on the phone was amazing after about 1 week of having it die faster. When you are using specific apps it dies quickly. You can go from 100 to 70 in just 10 mins. Also, it tends to burn up when you are using apps.Price: The iPhone 11 stands at about $409 and $521 Canadian. Before the price was a lot higher but with a price like this it is a must-get for anyone looking for a decent Phone.I compared the iPhone 11 to the iPhone 10. The build is the same, it looks the same other than the camera. The iPhone X takes a point for battery life. The iPhone 11 dies faster than the iPhone X. the iPhone 11 has a much better camera than the X because it has 1.71x more megapixels which make the camera a lot better. And if you are a person that likes to play games the iPhone 11 has a higher resolution, a fast download time and the CPU is great. So the iPhone 11 is Better than the iPhone X.The iPhone 11 is the same as the XR. It has one less camera than Apple's more-premium models, and its screen isn't nearly as nice. There are advantages to the Pros, but after getting a for what the iPhone 11 is capable of, spending the extra $300 is not a bad thing, it is really good and worth it.\", 'Good phones', '  My boyfriend and I both got phones and they work perfectly.

This product is The iphone 11, created by Apple. Apple also makes other electronics such as tablets, bluetooth earphones, smart watches, computers, streaming devices and even accessories to go with these devices. I have had this product for about two years now, and it's still working perfectly fine. This product looks like the iPhone XR but with two caramers.  It’s all red, with the word “(Product) RED” on it. It is 128GB with a 6.1 inch screen size. This is one of the best iPhones Apple has created.You might ask how this product works, and how could you use it? The product is a phone so you can call out on it. You can FaceTime other iPhone users, you can also browse through the web, you can take pictures one, and you can text people. This product is very easy to use and if you don’t know how to use it they come with a “HOW TO” so you can get a good understanding of your phone. I have used this product to the max. I have done everything with this phone. For example, I have played games on it, called people, and texted them. I have also sent emails, plus I have done my school work with it.What are some pros and cons of this iPhone? Well some pros would have to be how good the phone looks. This iPhone was  one of the first phones to have two camera. This phone has one of the faster smartphone chips in it. Which means the phone moves faster and loads up thighs a lot faster. Some more pros are that it has very good video, and screen quality. The iPhone also comes in more new colors then any other phone.The cons are lower than you think. One of them is that it didn’t come with the new fast charger unlike the 11 pro max and up. This phone didn’t come with an ultra wide lens, which means that any phone that’s newer than this phone has a better camera. Some more are that it didn’t have any updates to the screen, so it’s still the same as the iPhone XR. And, lastly the phone only comes with 64 to 256GB, so there's less storage on the phone.In conclusion you see that this is a great phone to purchase. The two years of experience I have is letting you know what I’m talking about. The pros and cons help you understand the phone some more, and it could help you towards your final purchase.\", '  perfect condition.

Like I had to redo adding my wifi and password, all the settings like country, prompts, etc. They made the return process so easy so I’ll give them props for that! Just got the “exchange” item. IT’S THE SAME EXACT PHONE I SENT BACK! I know because I recognize the small set of scuffs in the top right hand corner. They asked if I wanted the same color and I specified if it was available or I’d even take a white if it was a better option. They just replaced the little back sticker that came off when I had to clean it the first time I received it because it arrived dirty( like how phones get when they’ve been on a case for a while and the random dust/gunk that kind of accumulates) and added a fancy gold charging cord instead of the play white one. For paying over $400 for a renewed phone like this one I’d say OVERPRICED. They should base their prices off of how the phone looks and not just charge the same for all phones. I can say I’m disappointed to say the very least. The battery life is 86%.  The renewed iPhone 8plus I ordered 2 years ago (from somewhere similar) came at 97% battery life.

I initiated a return process after the hassle of importing everything onto it then having to reverse the process when I realized the phone was possessed. I contacted the company and their big solution was to have me take the phone to a local repair shop like it was a pair of shoes and get an estimate for repairs, send them said estimate and they would then reimburse for the repair cost if the estimate was to their liking.NO WAY!! Ludacris, absurd solution! I finally had to get Amazon customer service involved, 6 phone calls over the span of a week and they were nice about it but I had to drive the phone 45 minutes to a UPS drop off spot after that and finally got a refund but not for the full price paid so I had to call Amazon AGIAN to get it fully rectified. Even the Amazon representative said this was a totally bogus response and proposed solution from the seller and to not buy 3rd party seller items in future. Lesson learned!

I had previously purchased a renewed Galaxy phone from Amazon and the phone was practically new for a small fraction of the price and it came with the original box and accessories.

Unfortunately, the iPhone I received was very visibly used with scratches littering both sides of the phone, but without deep cracks to the screen. The battery's health was on the lower side. The phone also came in a generic box with generic accessories, which was to be expected since it is in the item description, but when you look at what you get for the renewed price it seems like a poor deal.

I figured that I could easily try the current iPhone and sell it again if I didn't like it. I am pleasantly surprised by pretty much everything this phone offers.I'm going to start with the battery life, because that is the because surprise I have had coming to this phone. On day one with my old phone, I would get at max 6 hours of SoT (screen on time) before the phone would die. That was typically enough for me to go from 6am to 10pm with enough left over for me to not feel worried about dying in the middle of the day. Prior to buying this phone that battery life dropped to roughly 3.5-4 hours of SoT before dying.This new (refurbished I know) phone easily gets ~8 hours of SoT, easily going even higher depending on what I'm doing. I can go a full two days without a charge. That's with bluetooth on 24/7. To say I am happy with the battery is an understatement.The other features, are also pretty good. Not anything that blows me out of the water, but definitely at least as good as the other competition. The face unlock, which I assumed was going to be terrible, is much better than I expected. I would still prefer a fast fingerprint sensor, but this thing does the job almost as well. I have had a few instances where it refuses to recognize me on the first attempt, but they are uncommon. The camera is as good as you would expect from a modern smartphone, with several extra features that are actually useful in certain circumstances.Long story short: I will definitely be sticking with this phone for the foreseeable future.\", 'Reviewed in Mexico on November 17, 2021Size: 256GBColor: BlackService Provider: UnlockedProduct grade: RenewedVerified Purchase', 'First paycheck spent correctly', '  Estetica de 10, buen funcionamiento.

It was a phone my sister no longer needed to I upgraded from the iphone 4. I haven't felt the need to upgrade since newer iphones basically do the same thing except for the facial thing blah blah. I don't need all that and I actually prefer a phone that has the wired jack plug. Why in the world did Apple ever do away with that?!Anyways, I realized I needed a new phone with the Iphone 6s plus started taking really crappy photos and was just slower overall even after I changed out the battery. So I started looking for newer phones and a friend recommended Amazon and that a renewed phone wasn't a bad way to go. The Iphone 11 purple 128 gb was a great deal considering brand new phones go for well over 1100-1300. I had some issues setting up the new iphone (my fault with forgetting my encryption passcode) but I was finally able to get the new iphone updated, transferred over my data, inserted the Sim card, and it works great with Mint Mobile. No issues so far with Mint that I have seen yet. The back and front did have a few slight smudges however it was nothing a tempered glass screen couldn't cover up and honestly I don't notice them at all when I am using the phone. It is in great condition but the battery is at 85% so I'm thinking in the next 6 months to 1 year I will need to replace the battery.Overall, this has been a great experience.

IT’S THE SAME EXACT PHONE I SENT BACK! I know because I recognize the small set of scuffs in the top right hand corner. They asked if I wanted the same color and I specified if it was available or I’d even take a white if it was a better option. They just replaced the little back sticker that came off when I had to clean it the first time I received it because it arrived dirty( like how phones get when they’ve been on a case for a while and the random dust/gunk that kind of accumulates) and added a fancy gold charging cord instead of the play white one. For paying over $400 for a renewed phone like this one I’d say OVERPRICED. They should base their prices off of how the phone looks and not just charge the same for all phones. I can say I’m disappointed to say the very least. The battery life is 86%.  The renewed iPhone 8plus I ordered 2 years ago (from somewhere similar) came at 97% battery life.

Sin embargo, lo compre y al siguiente día ya me lo habían entregado. Entre lo primero que quise ver fue la batería ya que muchos mencionaban que venía de 80 a 90 de capacidad y el teléfono que me llegó la trae del 100%.En cuanto a la estética le doy un 8/10, ya que tiene algunos detalles en la parte superior e inferior pero nada que me moleste (al menos a mí) y en la parte de atrás se ven apenas unos rayones, nada de qué preocuparse.Quedo satisfecho con la compra. Lo estaré probando por varios meses y si detectó algo raro lo publicaré.Pd. El face ID jala bien, la cámara igual y en las pocas horas que llevo de uso no se me ha trabado.Actualización: llevo dos semanas de uso y el teléfono se ha comportado a la perfección. La batería me dura un día y medio con uso moderado (sólo uso redes sociales y de vez en cuando veo algún video). También en cuanto a la carga creo que está bien. Lo pongo a cargar cuando está entre 15% y 20% y normalmente se carga en hora y media.Seguiré reportando camaradas!De momento recomiendo ampliamente a este vendendor ya que igual compré un iPhone X y tampoco ha tenido fallas e incluso llegó con estética de 10 y batería al 100%', 'pedro robelly3.0 out of 5 stars', '  Todo funciona súper bien.
